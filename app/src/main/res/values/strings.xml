    <!-- Demo Introduction Screen -->
    <string name="demo_introduction">This is a demonstration of RateTheApp.\n\nRateTheApp is a custom component made by Brightec for Android developers.  It displays a rating bar and a title and provides customised behaviour depending on the rating selected.\n\nThe default behaviour for a low rating is to prompt the user to email the developer.  The default behaviour for a high rating is to prompt the user to leave a rating on the Play Store and then hide itself.</string>
